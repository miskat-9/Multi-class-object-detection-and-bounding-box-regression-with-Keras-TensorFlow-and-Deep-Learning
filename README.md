# Multi-class-object-detection-and-bounding-box-regression-with-Keras-TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning
The project employs a Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN) architecture, utilizing transfer  learning through the VGG16 model pre-trained on  the ImageNet dataset. The CNN is fine-tuned to  create a custom classifier for the specific image  categories of interest, namely motorbikes, airplanes,  and faces.

This project uses three classes from the Caltech-101 dataset.
